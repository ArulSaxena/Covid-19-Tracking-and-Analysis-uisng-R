## Introduction

The scope of this project is to investigate and visualize the dataset of COVID-19 cases
using Data science techniques. When identifying infected, the values are plotted.This also can predict the outcome of a future pandemic curve. This curve of case rise and fall can be taken as a study to provide more data for future use.

Thorough this project we want to showcase the importance and power of R and why it is so
popular and recommended by data science professionals. This project was made to give a
better visualization of the covid-19 pandemic, how it spread across India…? and what was the effect of the lockdown in slowing the spread…? 

## Proposed Work

### Scope
The scope of this project is to investigate and visualize the dataset of COVID-19 cases
using Data science techniques. When identifying infected, the values are more plotted.
This also can predict the outcome of a future pandemic curve. This curve of case rise
and fall can be taken as a study to provide more data for future use.

#### An Efficient Approach of Tracking Covid-19
Tech companies, governments, and international agencies have all announced measures to help contain the spread of the COVID-19. Data representation can be one the best and efficient way of keeping a track of large amounts of data.The use of a systematic mapping betwee ngraphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization can help a lot.This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or colour, will change to reflect changes in the value of a datum.


## Proposed Model

The aim is of this project is to track covid-19 pandemic in our country. As we know the
government of India have taken a great number of steps to handle this unprecedented crisis.But this kind of crisis can’t be handled just by lockdown measures and social distancing.What is necessary is proper tracking of cases and real time update of the same. Testing is of no use if proper data base is not maintained for keep track of the progress.This gives us an opportunity to explore this huge amount of data. Analyse it and get meaningful results from it. This brings an opportunity to our door steps. Through deep studying of the data and information generated by the governments across the world we can get a better and visual understanding of this pandemic.
